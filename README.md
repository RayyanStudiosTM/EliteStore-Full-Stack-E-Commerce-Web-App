## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to run **EliteStore** locally:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18.x or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
*   **npm** or **Yarn**: These package managers are typically installed with Node.js.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/elitestore.git
    cd elitestore
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Navigate into the project directory and install the required packages.

    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    Or using Yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project with the following (these are for a full-stack setup, you might not need all for the frontend only):
    ```
    DB_URL=
    SECRET=
    STRIPE_SECRET=
    RAZORPAY_KEY=
    RAZORPAY_SECRET=
    ```

### Running the Development Server (Frontend)

To run the Next.js frontend application in development mode with hot-reloading:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

### Building for Production (Frontend)

To create an optimized production build of the Next.js frontend application:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run build
```

Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```

This command will generate the production-ready files in the `.next` directory.

### Running the Production Build Locally (Frontend)

After building, you can serve the optimized production build locally to test its performance:

Using npm:
```bash
npm run start
```

Or using Yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will also typically run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
